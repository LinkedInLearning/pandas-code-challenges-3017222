Want to test your pandas skills? These concise challenges let you stretch your brain and test your talents. Instructor Harshit Tyagi shares over a dozen pandas challenges, as well as his own solutions to each problem. Harshit’s challenges cover: Reading files and initial exploration of data using pandas attributes; data cleaning; creating subsets of data using indexing and slicing; writing queries to filter out rows based on conditional statements and Boolean indexing; and grouping and aggregation to answer categorical questions. Learn to apply statistical functions to groups. And since each challenge is self-contained, you can complete the course in any order—and at your own pace. Tune in to get the hands-on practice you need to keep your skills sharp.
